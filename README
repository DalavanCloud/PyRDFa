*** THIS IS AN OUTDATED VERSION, KEPT ONLY FOR HISTORICAL REASONS ***

The software to be used is at the https://github.com/RDFLib/pyrdfa3 repo; that one has been updated to RDFa 1.1, and has also been used to incorporate native RDFa processing into RDFLib. Keep away from this version:-)

(I do not know whether there users directly referring to this URI and repo, that is the only reason I do not remove the repo altogether.)

=============


An RDFa parser for Python, also referred to as a “RDFa Distiller”. 

It is deployed, via a CGI front-end, on the W3C `RDFa Distiller page <http://www.w3.org/2007/08/pyRdfa/>`.
